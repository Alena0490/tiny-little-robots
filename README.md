# 🤖 Tiny Little Robots

A demo e-shop built with React, TypeScript and Vite. Browse and "buy" unique robotic companions, each with an interactive 3D model. Orders trigger a real email confirmation via EmailJS.

> ⚠️ **This is a demo project.** No real payments are processed. Google Pay runs in TEST mode. Your email is used solely to send a demo order confirmation and is not stored anywhere.
